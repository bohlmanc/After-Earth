1) Create your node in blender
2) Save into the Meshes folder of your project
3) Create a new game object in the hierarchy
4) Rename to "NODENAMEnode"
5) Add a Harvestable Respawn Controller script to the object
6) Set the respawn time to the appropriate interval (in seconds)

Now, we need to create the actual node to be harvested
1) Drag the previously created node from the meshes folder into the hierarchy
2) Add a collider to the part of the mesh you wish to be interactable
3) Add a Harvestable Object Controller script to the object
4) Fill in the appropriate field
5) Drag this object from the hierarchy to the Assets -> Resources -> _Resources folder
6) Delete this object from the hierarchy

Now, back to the Node:
7) Drag the prefab of your resource into the Prefab field in the inspector
8) Drag the game object into the Assets -> Resources -> _ResourceNodes folder
9) Delete this object from the hierarchy
